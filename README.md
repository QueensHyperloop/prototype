# Prototype Team Software
## Overview
The Queen's Hyperloop Team is preparing a 1/50th scale prototype for demonstration and testing purposes. More info can be found at our [website](http://queenshyperloop.com/).

This project uses a [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/) as a WiFi enabled brain for the hyperloop pod to read and stream real-time sensor data. The Photon is wirelessly controlled from Raspberry Pi microcomputer running a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) app, by running [VoodooSpark firmware](https://github.com/voodootikigod/voodoospark) and the [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/) framework. A web dashboard is included to publicly display info during demonstrations, and info is collected for study using [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/).
